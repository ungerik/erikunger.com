        <h2>The Principle of Fair Exchange</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The principle of fair exchange is a basic law of nature: Paying a fair price for a fair service in a timely manner.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Pay yourself first!</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Selfishness doesn’t serve; enlightened self-interest does.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no such thing as a free lunch.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Make a list of anything or anyone in your life that feels incomplete or out of balance, and find a way to
                    bring it back into fair exchange. It will have an incredible effect on your mind and your finances!</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>If you think you have nothing, why would the universe invest in you? (compare it to a bank; if you have nothing
                the bank won’t lend you money)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Entropy is the tendency for things to break down, to go from an ordered to an disordered state, so every time
                you put money into a more disordered system than your own, entropy takes over and system is further dissipated.
                The universe is trying to teach you to invest in higher order and inspiration, and when you don’t, you receive
                a lesson. (Erik: Invest in lowering the entropy of the world)</li>

            <span id="more-378"></span>The Secret of Charity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>The wisest way to give a donation, contribute to a charity or tithe is to do it anonymously.</strong> (Erik:
                Then you play the part of the universe for the receiver, the receiver is grateful and inspired by the universe
                and you get your thank back from the universe instead from the receiver – who might not have what you want)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Anytime you invest in inspiration rather than desperation, your inner self wealth grows.</strong>
            </li>

            <a id="The_Power_of_Appreciation" name="The_Power_of_Appreciation"></a>
        </p>
        <h2>The Power of Appreciation</h2>
        <p>Appreciation raises the frequency of your consciousness, and ingratitude lowers it. Whenever you fail to appreciate
            what you give and receive, you lower your potential energy and block the channels through which you heavenly
            wealth can flow.</p>
        <p>Every time you play a bill or write a check in the state of resentment or ingratitude, that’s the message you send
            into the world. From now on, send a different message.&nbsp;
            <strong>Whenever you receive a bill or an invoice, have thanks that somebody appreciated you so much that they lent you
                money or gave you a product, service or idea in advance.</strong> They had the confidence and trust in you
            to invest in you, and you’re now writing a check of appreciation back to them,. Remember the beauty of saying
            “Payment is due when service is rendered.”</p>
        <p>Instead of begrudging the expense, remember how what you’re paying for has served you, and pay that bill in a state
            of appreciation and gratitude. Give thanks for what you’ve already received, give thanks for being able to pay
            for it, and watch how it transforms your relationship with wealth. Rather than a sense of lack or loss, this,
            creates a feeling of enrichment and abundance.&nbsp;
            <strong>When you feel different about sending wealth into the world, the world will feel different about sending wealth
                back to you.</strong>Transactions cease to be about gain and loss and become a flow. This is financial metaphysics,
            and it works.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>You set the standard, and the more you raise that value, the more you receive it.</strong>

        <ul>
            <li>When you can take the things you judge in yourself and appreciate them to the point where it wouldn’t matter
                if people found out, you’ll attain real self-love.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The world is a mirror that shows how you feel about yourself and with self-love there’s little fear of such reflection.</li>

                and be less in my life!”</li>

        <h2>The Spiritual Laws of Saving</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Until you manage money wisely, don’t expect more money to manage.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed incomes lead to fixed lifestyles because of fixed thinking.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Save 10% of your net income per month on your immortal savings account. Increase the savings rate every quarter
                by 10%.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Set up automated transfers for your savings. Pay yourself first.</li>

        <h2>Manage Your Emotions… or They’ll Manage You</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>“
                <strong>Until you can mange your emotions, don’t expect to be able to manage money.</strong>” -Warren Buffet</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Emotion, not love, is blind.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>“Excessive pains and pleasures are justly to be regarded as the greatest disease to which the soul is liable.
                For a man who is in great joy or in great pain, in his unseasonable eagerness to attain the one and avoid
                the other, is not able to see or hear anything right; he is mad, and is at time utterly incapable of any
                participation in reason.” -Plato</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Decide how much you’d love to make in a day, and simply start carrying that amount in your wallet. Don’t spend
                this money. It’s purely a psychological cushion, so put it in a separate section of your wallet, away from
                your spending money. (To have no money in your pocket is like driving on empty)</li>

            <li>“Nothing happens in this world until somebody sells something to somebody.” -Walter Hailey</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Everyone is in marketing and sales, whether they know it or not.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>When you love yourself and become inspired, so will others. Marketing is a test of how much inspiration, self-love,
                and other-love you have, as well as your ability and certainty in communicating it.</li>

        <h3>Sell the Sellers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When a sales person comes to you: Instead of it being an annoyance, be prepared and turn it into an opportunity

        <h3>The Seven Stages of Selling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Greet or introduce</strong>. Make sure you introduce yourself with a smile. People form opinions within the
                first three to five seconds of meeting you, so your voice, dress, eye contact, and manner are crucial here.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Establish rapport</strong>. Similarities forge bonds. The quicker you can ask people questions about their
                lives that lead to common threads between you and them, the easier it is to sell.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Identify their need</strong>. What’s their primary or immediate need? find out what appears to be missing
                or problematic in their lives. The numbers of rejections you receive during the selling process are inversely
                proportionality to how well you’ve established their need or void. The deeper and broader their need, the
                easier it is to sell.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Confirm their need</strong>. Be certain that you’ve established their true need. When they’ve told you what
                their need of void is, repeat this back to them. It’s wiser to know than to assume or guess.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Offer value</strong>. Tailor you work as a solution to their issue. Make an offer they can’t refuse. If someone
                says thy can’t afford or don’t want something, all that means is you haven’t demonstrated value in their
                terms – so communicate more value!&nbsp;
                <strong>People never have alack of money, they have a lack of motivation. If you provide the motivation, they’ll
                    find the money</strong>. (Extreme example: What if the life of your children depends on something; would
                you find the money for it? Everything depends on motivation)</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Close</strong>. Make the sale. Don’t leave it vague – confirm the appointment, get the credit-card details,
                and arrange delivery and payment. Make it happen.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Provide service</strong>. Deliver the service you promised.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>The art of selling requires the ability to listen, so listen carefully and tailor your questions to fit your
                potential customers’ responses and needs. Link you services or products to your customers’ specific values
                and your products will sell themselves.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Honestly care. Be sure that your product or service truly fits their needs and values. If you try to fool people,
                they’ll eventually catch on. When you’re sincere and speak from your heart, they’ll respond most favorably.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>To sell is not to tell. To sell is to ask. And occasionally it’s best to just be silent. Silence has power.</li>

                <strong>Caring and selling are actually identical; they both mean knowing and meeting people’s values.</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>A relationship is a buying-and-selling proposition. To raise your value in the relationship marketplace, you
                must know the other person’s values and figure out how to fulfill them. If you can’t do that,&nbsp;
                <em>you</em> have little or no value.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>They’re sharing their life with you and the instant they feel strongly enough that they’re not getting value
                for their investment, they’ll go somewhere else, just like your clients.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Money and beauty are powerful forces in the relationship marketplace, and if you don’t have one, it helps to
                have the other. To think otherwise is just another fantasy.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no such thing as, “Now that I have my partner, I can take him or her for granted.” You’re responsible
                for maintaining fair exchange, even in your relationships.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>God Is in the Details</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Whatever your dreams is, take the time to work it out in great detail. Any details you can’t see and leave out
                of your vision becomes an obstacle or challenge you’ll attract or face, and the obstacles are designed to
                help you clarify your vision.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Failing to plan is planning to fail, but if you take the time to define and refine exactly what you’d love to
                be, do, and have in your life, that’s what begins to appear.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>It’s a simple fact that those who plan their lives, their careers, and their finances go further and end up with
                more life and wealth than those who don’t.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>If you would love a life that conforms to your highest dream and vision, you’re responsible to be clear about
                    what that is.</strong>

        <h3>Space and Time</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The magnitude of the space and time horizons within you innermost dominant thoughts determines the level of conscious
                evolution you’ve obtained. Inspired beings have big dreams. They think in long time frames and draw power
                from their visions.</li>

        </p>
        <h3>Global Vision</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When your financial purpose and dreams are focused on more than you immediate material needs, when they encompass
                the entire globe and all of humanity, a magical financial magnetism begins to emerge. Without a great purpose
                and vision, great events, accomplishments, and financial resources are unlikely to arise.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>If you’d love to make a difference in yourself, you’d better have a vision at least as big as your family. If
                you’d love to make difference in your family, you’d better have a vision as big as your city. If you’d love
                to make a difference in your city, your vision must be as big as your state. If you’d love to make a difference
                in your state, you’d better have a vision as big as your nation. If you’d love to make a difference in you
                nation, you’d better have a vision as grand as the world. And if you’d love to have a global impact, you’d
                better have immortal vision.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>First visualize, then write down, your goals and purpose. Why? Because writing acts as the first step in taking
                things from the world of imagination to the physical world by defining them in space-time.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Writing is a form of creation. It clarifies your mind and when your mind is crystal clear on what it would love,
                it finds a way to manifest those goals.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Affirmation: “I’m the vision, God’s (or&nbsp;

        </p>
        <h3>A Cause</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If you don’t have something challenging and fulfilling to awaken for in the morning, you won’t rise and shine.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Unless your goals are vast and growing, you’ll tend to slow down as you approach their fulfillment rather than
                letting yourself run out of things to do. That’s why it’s important to keep clarifying your purpose and expanding
                your goals and dreams.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Even with a clear purpose, you’ll occasionally be distracted and uninspired. The only reason you’re not inspired
                at those times is because you haven’t linked what you’re doing to your purpose. Make a list of everything
                you do in a normal day and ask yourself, “How does that help me fulfill my mission?” Keep linking everything
                to what you’d love and find its meaning and significance in your life. Anything you don’t see as part of
                your purpose feels pointless, and the ratio of pointlessness to purposefulness is how much hell or heaven
                you have in your life. Ask that question and keep asking and linking until it doesn’t matter what you do,
                you feel you';re on purpose. The truth is that everything you do is connected, and the more you link your
                actions to your purpose, the more you get to do what you love.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Money flees from those who have no purpose for it, an flows to those who do.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The universe meets you halfway. (that’s why your cause must be double the size of what you want to achieve)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>What vision brings tears of inspiration to your eyes?</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>The quality of your life is based on the quality of the questions you ask.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>“You are never give a wish without also being give the power to make it come true. You may have to work for it
                however.” -Richard Bach</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Challenge is the barrier that must be overcome before you can grow to the next level. If it were easy, everyone
                would do it. There’s a selection process going on, and those who are willing to pay the price and face their
                fears get the rewards. A great purpose gives you the courage to transcend your own limitations and achieve
                great riches.</li>

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>When you have a glimpse of your purpose, the next challenge is to manifest it. Every morning, write down the
                seven highest priority action steps you know you can take to help you fulfill your dreams and purpose. Schedule
                your day to give priority to what’s most important to you. Do this every day for a month and you’ll begin
                to see a pattern.</li>
