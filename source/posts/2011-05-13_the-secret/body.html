            <li>Appreciate all the riches around you, including the riches of others. Look for wealth wherever you go, and appreciate
                it.</li>
            <li>Be clear about the amount of money you want to receive. State it and intend it! Don’t think about how much you
                can earn, but how much you want to receive.</li>
            <li>Love yourself and know that you are deserving and worthy of an abundance of money.</li>

            <span id="more-392"></span>Relationships:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can completely transform any relationship, no matter what it’s like right now. (Erik: Don’t confuse that
                with transforming the people in relationships)</li>
            <li>Every single relationship you have is a reflection of how you feel inside about you. You are a magnet attracting
                to you all things, via the signal you are emitting through your thoughts and feelings. Every relationship
                you have and every interaction with every person, is a reflection of your own thoughts and feelings in that
                very moment.</li>
            <li>Make lists of hundreds and hundreds of wonderful things about you. Keep adding to it every day.</li>
            <li>Focus on the wonderful things in every person. Look for only those things. (Erik: Conflicts with Demartini’s
                advice to appreciate every aspect of a person by finding out how negatively perceived traits are helping
                you)</li>
            <li>Do not blame or criticize anybody, ever.</li>
            <li>Set an intention that you are going to see the best in everything and everyone.</li>
            <li>Make your happiness the number one thing in your life. Happiness is an inside job. (Erik: Conflicts with Demartini’s
                advice to search balance. Happiness is a one sided feeling and can’t persist for ever. Love and and fulfillment
                through balance of happiness and sadness)</li>
            <li>Free yourself of the responsibility of trying to make other people happy. Respect and love them enough to allow
                them to take care of their own happiness.</li>
            <li>Appreciate and love yourself in every moment you can.</li>
