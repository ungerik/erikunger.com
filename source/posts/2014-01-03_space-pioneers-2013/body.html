        <p>What’s going on in space and why should we care? Let me begin with two images:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Solar-System-Resources.jpeg" alt="Solar-System-Resources"
                width="700" height="350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-659">
        </p>
        <p>I think the first image is self-explanatory; there is enough energy in space as well as down here on earth. The second
            one depicts asteroids in the inner solar system. Those asteroids have enough material to hypothetically construct
            big, comfortable space stations that combined would provide 3,000 times the surface area of earth – all as living
            space for future generations. So are we all doomed because current technology and policy don’t allow sustainable
            living on earth? Of course not. But it will take bold pioneers to take on the next “giant leap for humankind.”</p>
        <h3>Cube-Sats</h3>
        <p>In last year’s space&nbsp;
            <a href="http://pioneersfestival.com/?p=1906">blog post</a>, we heard about top billionaire pioneers who are investing in space. But billions are not always
            necessary to create something of value. The rising&nbsp;
            <a href="http://pioneers.io/blog/hardware-is-the-new-software-chris-anderson"
                target="_blank">makers movement</a>&nbsp;doesn’t stop at hard space tech. For instance, the development of nano-satellites is
            driven by the same mechanics that brought computers into every home – smaller, cheaper, built by entrepreneurial
            teams headquartered in a garage or dorm room:</p>

        </p>
        <p>Startups like&nbsp;
            <a href="http://gomspace.com/">GomSpace</a>,&nbsp;
            <a href="http://www.solarsystemexpress.com/">Solar System Express</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;
            <a href="http://www.infinityaerospace.io/">Infinity Aerospace</a>&nbsp;are catering to that audience with parts and kits to build satellites. The startup&nbsp;
            <a
                href="http://www.nanosatisfi.com/">NanoSatisfi</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;
                <a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/OPS-SAT_Evolving_Software_Technology_for_Spacecraft_Operations">OPS-SAT</a>&nbsp;mission of the European Space Agency are democratizing access to satellites by providing
                timeshare plans for experiments. On the software side, there are space related hackathons and competitions
                like&nbsp;
                <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">Space Apps Challenge</a>,&nbsp;
                <a href="http://www.app-camp.eu/index2.php?show=winner">ESA App Camp</a>,&nbsp;
                <a href="http://www.copernicus-masters.com/index.php?kat=challenges.html&amp;anzeige=esa2013.html">ESA App Challenge</a>, or the Austrian&nbsp;
                <a href="http://www.ffg.at/news/innovative-space-apps">FFG Space Apps Competition</a>&nbsp;blooming all over the world.</p>
        <h3>Makers</h3>
        <p>The 3D printing boom is also highly relevant to space. Getting parts delivered to the international space station
            is very costly. Supplying future Mars missions in the nick of time will be straight out impossible. Think about
            processing the resources from future space mining directly in space instead of transporting them back to earth.
            We will need completely new fabrication methods that work in zero gravity. 3D printing seems to be the best solution
            for all of these challenges. There is even a competition to 3D print rocket engines with
            <a href="http://www.openspaceuniversity.org/#!rocketchallenge/c22xk">DIYROCKETS</a>.</p>
        <p>But the ultimate DIY rocket maker project has to be&nbsp;
            <a href="http://www.copenhagensuborbitals.com/">Copenhagen Suborbitals</a>. Those guys are building a complete suborbital rocket with solely their hands and
            outside donations. It will take them some time to really fly a human, but so far they have come further than
            anyone thought possible. Watch some DIY space capsule building&nbsp;
            <a href="http://youtu.be/px1sVXH0xME">here</a>.</p>
        <h3>Rocket test flights</h3>
        <p>What’s new with the big guys? SpaceX has made great progress, delivering cargo to the International Space Station
            and earning well-paid contracts from NASA, military and private satellite companies. But the most exciting development
            is their attempt to create a fully reusable rocket to make space travel as efficient as air travel is today.
            Currently SpaceX is testing the vertical landing of their Falcon 9’s first stage called Grasshopper. Check out
            the video:</p>

        </p>
        <p>Another contender for the orbital transportation market is Amazon founder and billionaire Jeff Bezo’s rocket company&nbsp;
            <a
                href="http://www.blueorigin.com/">Blue Origin</a>. It’s the most secretive of the lot, but at least we also have a vertical takeoff and landing
                video from them:</p>

            <iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NANePoo_p30?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        </p>
        <p>There is also fire behind Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo:</p>
        <p>
            <iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/M1GiAOzKz4k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        </p>
        <p>The engines are always the most difficult part of a rocket and&nbsp;
            <a href="http://www.thespaceshipcompany.com/">The Space Ship Company</a>&nbsp;(TSC, the company building Virgin Galactic’s air- and spacecraft) had to completely
            redevelop its engine with help of a more experienced contractor. Now it’s looking good for the first suborbital
            flight by the end of the year and passenger flights at least one year after that.</p>
        <h3>More space crafts</h3>
        <p>A new entry in the race to space is&nbsp;
            <a href="http://www.s-3.ch/en/home">Swiss Space Systems</a>. Their technical concept is similar to Virgin Galactic. The difference is that their
            spaceship will be mounted on top of an Airbus 300 instead of under the wing of a carrier plane:</p>

            <iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gZ0Aos45atk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        </p>
        <p>Further down the development road is Sierra Nevada Corporation with their mini Space Shuttle-like Dream Chaser that
            will be boosted on top of a conventional rocket:</p>
        <p>
            <iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cz7Po6lEw9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
        </p>
        <h3>NASA and Bigelow</h3>
        <p>Even NASA is working on a new rocket, the&nbsp;
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System">SLS</a>&nbsp;(Space Launch System). It will be built with components from the shuttle program and the strongest
            version will be able to haul 130 tons to low earth orbit. That’s 12 tons more than the Saturn rocket from the
            Apollo program. Such heavy lifting capabilities will enable new human exploration programs, like to asteroids,
            for example. Or it will be able to bring the biggest inflatable space station modules from Bigelow Aerospace
            into orbit. Here is an image of Bigelow’s medium-sized modules:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Bigelow_Alpha_-Station.jpg" alt="Bigelow Alpha Station"
                width="500" height="387" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-666">
        </p>
        <p>Bigelow just announced an agreement to place a smaller test module, the&nbsp;
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigelow_Expandable_Activity_Module">Bigelow Expandable Activity Module</a>&nbsp;(BEAM) onto the International Space Station. There are also plans
            to use the modules as shelter for a moon station.</p>
        <h3>Interplanetary</h3>
        <p>Let’s move on from space stations to inter-world space travel.&nbsp;
            <a href="http://mars-one.com/">Mars One</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
            <a href="http://goldenspikecompany.com/">Golden Spike</a>&nbsp;are aiming to bring humans to Mars and Moon, respectively. Their business models couldn’t
            be more different at the moment. While Mars One wants to select their astronauts out of average citizens and
            finance the mission with a reality show, Golden Spike is looking for wealthy individuals to pay US$1.5 billion
            for a two-person Moon landing. Mars One has no immediate plans to bring their crew back, in contrast to a tourist
            round-trip package offered by Golden Spike.</p>
        <p>Not a landing, but just a flyby around Mars is the goal of&nbsp;
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Tito">Denis Tito</a>’s&nbsp;
            <a href="http://www.inspirationmars.org/">Inspiration Mars</a>&nbsp;project. Denis Tito, the first space tourist, won’t be flying himself. He is looking
            for a married couple to make the trip. If it’s true that most relationships end during vacation, then this couple
            better have a very strong marriage to survive!</p>
        <h3>Space Mining</h3>
        <p>So there are quite a few fascinating space projects in the works, but maybe none will be as important for humankind
            than&nbsp;
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_mining">space-mining</a>. We only have limited resources here on earth, and if we desire to settle in space and resupply
            earth, we will need to make use of the limitless wealth that space has to offer.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.planetaryresources.com/">Planetary Resources</a>&nbsp;is on its way to becoming the first space mining company, that is, if they are not
            beaten by their new contender&nbsp;
            <a href="http://deepspaceindustries.com/">Deep Space Industries</a>. As with any other serious mining project, Planetary Resources begins with prospecting.
            Thus, their first generation of spacecraft will consist of telescopes designed to find, map, and categorize those
            hundreds of thousands of asteroids. One of those telescope satellites will display images from&nbsp;
            <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1458134548/arkyd-a-space-telescope-for-everyone-0">Kickstarter campaign</a>&nbsp;funders, which will be photographed with a backdrop of earth, the moon or whatever
            they choose.&nbsp;Oh, and Richard Branson funded the Kickstarter campaign with 100k and also joined Planetary
            Resources’ core group of investors.</p>
        <p>Let’s wrap up this long post with Deep Space Industries gorgeous introduction video. If you only want to watch one
            video from this post, this is the one:</p>
