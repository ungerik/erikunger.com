    Currently offering transmissions at the <a href="https://www.amplifyconference.net/">Amplify Conference</a> in Denver:

    <h1>Session with Erik:</h1>
    
    <div><b>The Deep Calmness Transmission</b> is my version of Shaktipat that includes a psychic chakra clearing before the transmission part with eye gazing and laying on hands for a few minutes. It typically results in a state of deep calmness and glimpses of later locations.</div>
    
    <div><b>The Hands-on Energy Healing</b> includes the calmness transmission and extends it to the whole body by laying on hands. It typically helps the nervous system to relax further while the mind may or may not be working through some issue.</div>
    
    <div>The Deep Calmness Transmission is the preferred session type because it's shorter and still nearly as powerful as the much longer Hands-on Energy Healing. To help as many people as possible please be understanding that in case of overbooking I would just perform the transmission part instead of the extended whole body session.</div>
    
    <div>All sessions at the event are free of cost!<br/>
    But if you feel like it, I am grateful for donations via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/ErikUnger">PayPal</a></div>
