		<description><![CDATA[This is a fantastic article. My case worker at my job agency was talking about this today. Often we get caught up in the &quot;urgent&quot; things - the things facing us right now, but we ignore the important things that need to be done. I need to spend more time on what&#039;s important. An example is this - I was asked to create a poster (for free by the way), and once I said yes, there was a deadline to do it by. It seemed &quot;urgent&quot; because a demand was put on me, but what was actually necessary for me to be doing, was working on a lot of important things in my life, but I chose the urgent thing because of the pressure put on me.]]></description>
