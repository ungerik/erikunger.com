Thanks for sharing your very detailed notes.  I enjoyed reading them especially as I&#039;ve been listening to Dr. Demartini&#039;s webinar. Have you heard any feedback from his live breakthrough sessions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Craig 
I understand why you might draw a conclusion that Dr Demartini&#039;s work is drawn from Buddhism but that is not the case. His teachings are based on his research, synthesis and mastery of the teachings of many philosophers and past masters in all areas of life. Of course, his teachings are vast and a synopsis of his work based on the book, The Breakthrough Experience, cannot possibly do justice to the breadth and depth of Dr Demartini&#039;s teachings.

If you have any interest in gaining a greater and more balanced perspective of his teachings I highly recommend you visit his website and The Demartini Institute. 
With gratitude,]]></description>
